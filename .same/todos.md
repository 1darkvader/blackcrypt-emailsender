# CloudFlare Deployment Fix Todos

## ✅ Completed
- [x] Fixed module resolution issue by adding "type": "module" to package.json
- [x] Successfully built the project locally

## 🔄 Next Steps
- [ ] Test CloudFlare deployment with the fix
- [ ] Verify all email functionality works in production
- [ ] Update environment variables if needed

## 📝 Issue Summary
The build was failing because:
1. `next.config.js` uses ES module syntax (`export default`)
2. `package.json` was missing `"type": "module"`
3. This caused module resolution conflicts during build

## ✅ Solution Applied
Added `"type": "module"` to package.json to properly specify the module type.
