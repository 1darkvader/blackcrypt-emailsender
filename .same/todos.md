# Email Campaign Sender - Development Todos

## 🚀 **IMPLEMENTING HYBRID APPROACH: Gmail OAuth + Resend API**

### 🎯 **USER REQUEST: Production-Ready Email System**

**Problem Analysis:**
- ✅ Demo data cleared successfully
- ❌ SMTP configurations unstable (localStorage-based, goes active/inactive)
- ❌ Campaign sending not working (no real authentication service)
- ❌ Need persistent, reliable email infrastructure

**Solution: Hybrid Approach Implementation**
- 🔄 Gmail OAuth Integration (real workspace authentication)
- 🔄 Resend API Integration (reliable email sending service)
- 🔄 Server-side JSON storage (no database, but persistent)
- 🔄 Real campaign queue management

## 📋 **IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**

### **Phase 1: Gmail OAuth Integration** 🔄
- [ ] Set up Google OAuth 2.0 configuration
- [ ] Create OAuth login flow for Gmail Workspace
- [ ] Replace app password authentication
- [ ] Add "Connect Gmail Workspace" button
- [ ] Store OAuth tokens securely server-side

### **Phase 2: Resend API Integration** 🔄
- [ ] Add Resend API configuration
- [ ] Create email sending service wrapper
- [ ] Implement reliable email delivery
- [ ] Add email tracking and analytics

### **Phase 3: Server-Side Persistence** 🔄
- [ ] Create JSON file storage system
- [ ] Migrate from localStorage to server storage
- [ ] Persist SMTP/OAuth configurations
- [ ] Store campaign data and queue
- [ ] Add backup/restore functionality

### **Phase 4: Campaign Queue Management** 🔄
- [ ] Build server-side campaign processor
- [ ] Implement real email queue system
- [ ] Add rate limiting and throttling
- [ ] Campaign status tracking
- [ ] Retry logic for failed sends

### **Phase 5: Enhanced UI/UX** 🔄
- [ ] Update SMTP config UI for OAuth flow
- [ ] Add Gmail Workspace connection status
- [ ] Real-time campaign sending progress
- [ ] Better error handling and feedback
- [ ] Production-ready dashboard

## 🛠 **CURRENT WORK: Starting Implementation**

**Status:** Building production-ready email infrastructure
**Priority:** HIGH - User needs reliable email sending
**Approach:** No database, file-based persistence, API-driven

**Benefits:**
- ✅ No database complexity
- ✅ Production-ready reliability
- ✅ Gmail Workspace OAuth login
- ✅ Persistent configurations across sessions
- ✅ Real email sending that actually works
- ✅ Built-in deliverability and tracking

## 🎯 **NEXT STEPS**
1. Implement Gmail OAuth integration
2. Add Resend API email service
3. Create server-side storage system
4. Build real campaign queue
